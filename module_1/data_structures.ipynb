    "#### Get\n",
    "\n",
    "The **get( )** method is used to fetch the value for a key in the dict. This method does not cause an error if the key does not exist. The object returned by this method is the value corresponding to the key (if exists) and **None** (if key does not exist). We can also specify the return value for a key that does not exist in the dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is  \n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Fetch a key that exists\n",

    "This keyword is used to create a dict using the **dict** function. While this is not a dictionary class method, this method is unique to the dictionaries as it allows us an alternative way to create a dict. In this function the key value pairs are passed as **key=value** format and each key-value pair of the dict is separated by a comma.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is  \n",

    "    Returns all the keys in the dict as a special type - **dict_keys**. It is a special data type associated with the dict class where the keys are stored inside a list. It is not possible to directly access the individual keys using indexing. The syntax for this is `dict.keys()` \n",

    "The **add(V)** method adds the value **V** to the set. Since the order is not guaranteed, where the value **V** will be inserted cannot be determined. If the item **V** is already present in the set, the method will have no effect. The syntax is `set.add(200)` which will add the value **200** to the set. This is an in-place method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remove\n",
    "\n",
    "The **remove(V)** method removes the item **V** from the set. The return value of this method is **None**. If the value **V** is not present in the set, it leads to an error. The syntax is `set.remove(100)` it removes the item 100 from the set if exists otherwise leads to an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pop\n",
    "\n",
    "The **pop( )** method is used to remove the first item of the set. While the index 0 position in a set does not exist, visually speaking, whatever is stored in the beginning of the set is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax is `a = set.pop()`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns the popped value as an integer. This is also an in-place method.  \n",

    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of these methods, sets operate like mathematical sets. We will use the below sets as examples  \n",

    "A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n",
    "```\n",

    "For every method below, the above two states of the variables **A** and **B** will be considered and all previous operations as a result of other examples shall be ignored.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The **difference( )** method calculates the mathematical difference between two sets. It is equivalent to the mathematical operation $A - B$ (depending on the order) where A and B are two sets. This is not an in-place method. Consider the example  \n",

    "#### DifferenceUpdate\n",
    "\n",
    "The **difference_update( )** method calculates the mathematical difference between two sets but also modifies the set in-place. The syntax is `A.difference_update(B)` and removes all the items from **A** which are common to **B**. Consider the example  \n",

    "#### Intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "The **intersection( )** method calculates the common items between the two sets. The syntax is `A.intersection(B)` and it returns a set of items that are common to the sets **A** and **B**. For this method, `A.intersection(B)` is the same as `B.intersection(A)`. This is not an in-place method. Mathematically, this operation is equivalent to the set operation $A \\bigcap\\ B$  \n",

    "\n",
    "The **isdisjoint( )** method is used to check for intersection between two sets. The syntax is `A.isdisjoint(B)` and returns **False** if there are common items between the sets **A** and **B**.

    "#### IsSubset\n",
    "\n",
    "The **issubset** method is used to check if a set is contained inside another set. The syntax is `A.issubset(B)` and it returns **True** if the items of set **A** are contained inside set **B**  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### IsSuperset\n",
    "\n",
    "The **issuperset( )** method is used to check if a set is contains another set inside it. This is the opposite of the **issubset( )** method. The syntax is `A.issuperset(B)` and returns **True** if all the items of set **B** are contained inside set **A**  \n",

    "\n",
    "The **union( )** method is used to create a new set from the sets **A** and **B** which combines all the unique items of these two sets. Common items in the sets are included only once. The syntax is `A.union(B)`. It is not an in-place method and returns a new set with all the unique items. Therefore, `B.union(A)` is the same as `A.union(B)`  \n",
